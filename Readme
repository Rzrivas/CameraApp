Used the following video to create this app https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN43W5AvTuI

It isn't really useful for anything I made it as a way to learn how to use different phone hardware.

Most of the code is copied aside from different variable names that I normally use.

The capture button just opens up the normal camera app on your phone and displays images taken in the image viewer on your phone.

It doesn't save the images no reason to since it is a way to learn how using different hardware and adding permissions in the manifest file.

I added a landscape layout as well so the capture button doesn't sit on top of the image viewer.

I added some screenshots as well.
